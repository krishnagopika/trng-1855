    "- 1 to 3: data preperation. done using managed datasets in vertexAI. lable and annotate the data.\n",
    "- train- AutoML and custom. img, vid, text and tabular - automl is suitable. custom model- tensorflow and pytorch.\n",
    "- Evaluate: explainable AI, evaluate the model and dive deeper into the model and understand it better.\n",

    "#### Training Steps & Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch:** The process of training the model once with the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch:** The entire dataset can not be passed for training at once. So, the datset is divided into parts called batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration:** No of training examples divided by the batch size gives the value of no of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model versioning helps you to create multiple versions of the same model. It helps to track the changes and performance metrics of the model. \n",
    "- The initial version is 1 and it increates with  each update or retraining of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process of creating new features(columns), tramsforming existing ones and selecting the most relevent features to train and imporve the performance of the model.\n",
    "- In vertex AI feature engineering is implemneted using the Vertex AI Feature store and feature transform engine.\n",
    "- If feature selection is enabled, Feature Transform Engine assigns an importance score to each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameters are the variables that control the model training. They are not related to the actual data used for the training.\n",
