    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit provides a fast interactive loop. Everytime there is a change in the source code, the streamlit detects and asks you if you want to rerun the app to refelct the chaanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose Always rerun to automatically update the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- streamlit reruns the entire python script when:\n",
    "1. you modify the apps source code.\n",
    "2. when user interacts with the widgets in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Streamlit uses `@st.cache_data` decorator to optimize the reruns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write\n",
    "\n",
    "- versatile command in streamlit. \n",
    "- multiple agguments can be passed. \n",
    "- the behavior depends on the input type.\n",
    "- retruns none, so its slot can't be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magic commands are a feature in streamlit to write anything without explicit command.\n",
    "- any variable or literal in streamlit file will ba automatically writen to your app using `st.write`.\n",
    "- to disable maic set `magicEnabled = false` in `~/.streamlit/config.toml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "- elemesnt of GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `st.slider`\n",
    "- `st.button`\n",
    "- `st.text_input`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "- used to organize the widgets.\n",
    "- `st.sidebar`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Themes\n",
    "\n",
    "- streamlit supports light and dark themes\n",
    "- settings --> theme -->select theme\n",
    "- streamlit also provides an option to select a custom theme\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- streamlit supports frictionless way to create multiple pages.\n",
    "- create a folder pages in the directory main page ans add python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**File names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A number — if the file is prefixed with a number.\n",
    "- A separator — could be _, -, space, or any combination thereof.\n",
    "- A label — which is everything up to, but not including, .py.\n",
    "- The extension — which is always .py.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Session State\n",
    "\n",
    "session state provides a dictionary like interface to store values between reruns.\n",
    "\n",
    "syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`st.session_state.key` or `st.session_state['key]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "- streamlit caches the result of expensive operations\n",
    "- to cache a result in streamlit, you need to decorate it with\n",
    "    - `@st.cache_data` : to cache data\n",
    "    - `@st.cache_resource`:  to cache global resources like db connections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- streamlit community cloud\n",
    "- custom deployment\n",
