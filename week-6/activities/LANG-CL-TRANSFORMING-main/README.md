This lab will utilize LangChain to transform documents. The main method of transforming documents will be splitting the contents into more manageable pieces. 

## Instructions
- The provided code for this lab contains some starter code to introduce the idea of transforming documents. You should read the pre-written code to understand the overall idea of document transformation. Once this is understood, look out for TODO statements and make the appropriate changes.

## Extra Reading
- Take a look at the official [Python Langchain Docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/get_started)
