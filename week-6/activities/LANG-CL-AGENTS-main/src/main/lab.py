We can now create the agent! No need to edit the code below.
We are using the initialize_agent function, providing it with the tools and llm defined above.  

We've defined the agent type as ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION. 
This is the most general type of agent. It determines which tool to use solely based on the tool descriptions.

By setting verbose=True, we can see what the agent is thinking/doing in the console. 

Finally, by setting return_intermediate_steps=True, we can access the intermediate steps of the agent.
This is useful for debugging and writing tests.
