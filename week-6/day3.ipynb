Here's an example code that prints all prime numbers up to a given number `n`:\\n```\\ndef print_primes(n):\\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\\n        is_prime = True\\n        for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\\n            if i % j == 0:\\n                is_prime = False\\n                break\\n        if is_prime:\\n            print(i)\\n```\\nHere's an explanation of the code:\\n\\n1. The function `print_primes` takes an integer `n` as input.\\n2. The loop `for i in range(2, n+1)` iterates over the numbers from 2 to `n`.\\n3. The variable `is_prime` is initialized to `True` for each iteration.\\n4. The loop `for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1)` checks whether `i` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `i`. If `i` is divisible by `j`, then `is_prime` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.\\n5. If `is_prime` is still `True` after the inner loop, then `i` is a prime number and it is printed.\\n\\nHere's an example usage of the function:\\n```\\nprint_primes(30)\\n```\\nThis will print all prime numbers up to 30, which are:\\n\\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\n\\nI hope this helps!

The number of iterations in the inner loop increases quadratically with n, so the overall time complexity is O(n^2).\\n\\nThe second code snippet you provided has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number entered by the user.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).\\n\\nIn terms of space complexity, both code snippets have a space complexity of O(1) because they only use a constant amount of memory, regardless of the size of the input.\\n\\nSo, the second code snippet is more efficient in terms of time complexity, but both code snippets have the same space complexity.'),\n",
       " 'code_comparision': AIMessage(content=\"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! The three codes you provided are all valid ways to find prime numbers up to a certain number, and they each have different time and space complexities.\\n\\n1. The first code uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to n, and then uses another for loop to check if the current number is prime. The time complexity of this code is O(n^2), because the inner loop runs up to sqrt(n) times, and the outer loop runs n times. The space complexity is O(1), because only a small amount of extra memory is needed to store the variables.\\n\\n2. The second code uses the `isprime` function from the `math.gcd` module to check if a number is prime. The time complexity of this code is O(n), because the `isprime` function takes constant time to execute, and the for loop runs n times. The space complexity is also O(1), because only a small amount of extra memory is needed to store the variables.\\n\\n3. The third code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a certain number. The time complexity of this code is O(n log log n), because the sieve algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the prime numbers are distributed unevenly, and only needs to check a subset of the numbers. The space complexity is O(n), because the sieve array needs to be able to store all the numbers up to n.\\n\\nIn general, the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is the most efficient way to find prime numbers up to a certain number, followed by the `isprime` function from the `math.gcd` module. The first code is the least efficient of the three, because it uses a nested loop that takes quadratic time.\")}"
